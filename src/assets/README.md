## Assets

All static assets for the application are included here. Generally static assets would be images. 

Localization files are considered static assets. These are located in `i18n`. The JSON files in the folder are named according to the culture code for which they provide their localizations. The structures of the JSON must be exactly the same between all files. Changes to the structure will necessitate changes to the component views.
